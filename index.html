        <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p>
            Weezer has been killing it for a long time. Their greatest album of
            all time is the Blue album. <br />
            The blue album, originally released in 1994, continues to be quite
            popular. So much so, that in 2012, <br />
            Weezer performed the entire album from start to finish to a sold out
            crowd in Orlando, Florida.
        </p>

        <p>
            While many of the albums released by Weezer over the last twenty
            five years have featured some great hits, <br />
            none of them can compete with the greatness that is the blue album.
            Of course, there is some debate amongst Weezer fandom <br />
            regarding the accuracy of that statement, but those people are
            wrong.
